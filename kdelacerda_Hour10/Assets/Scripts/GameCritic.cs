Is the game too easy or hard?
    Game is very simple, but doesn't really give the player a challenge,
    as the player can just stand there, do nothing, and eventually the
    balls will make it into the goals.
What would make it easier or harder?
    More obstacles or additional goals could make it harder. Maybe a few 
    blocks or obstacles near the goals, but even that would just delay
    the ball from making it into the goal, not necessarily making it better,
    just making it longer. 
What would give it a “wow” factor?  
    A challenge of some sort, such as a score board, tracking how long it took 
    to clear the colored balls from the table, so that the player could try to
    beat their best time. Something that pops up at the start and explains 
    what is going on. Add a goal of using the players bumper to take out the 
    chaos balls. Maybe add more chaos balls, and make the winning requirements
    to be 'clear the chaos balls before the colored balls reach their goal' so
    there is the possibility of failing. 
What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?
    Personally, I didn't find this a "fun" game, as I was able to just hit the
    play button and stand there, watching the balls eventually make it in, with no
    action needed on my part. I had the option of chasing the ball, to try to make 
    it reach its goal faster, but that wasn't necessary. 
    The game itself isn't tedious, as again, the player truely does not have a 
    purpose. Or maybe that is the tedious part - the game isn't over until the balls
    go into their respective goals, so the player is waiting for the ball to finally
    make its way to the right corner. 
    Now, if this question is more meant towards the creation of this game, it was a 
    good way to learn new mechanics, like creating your own physic material, or applying 
    other aspects we've learned to creating the game. It also wasn't tedious to build it,
    as it was pretty simple to copy/paste, just had to remember to update the copied items
    location/tags/name, etc. 

    Changes
    (DONE) Try adding a button that allows the player to play again whenever the game is completed.  
    (DONE DID) Try adding a timer so that the player knows how long it took to win.  
    (DID ISH?) Try adding variations of the chaos balls. - Added more, different rotations, same speed.
    (YEPPERS) Try adding a chaos goal that you must bounce all the chaos balls into.  
    (YEP! CHECK OUT ITS FACE!) Try changing the size or shape of the player’s bumper. 
    (YEP) Try changing the footsteps audio to something that makes more sense with the water. 

    (NO) Try making a complex bumper out of many shapes.   
    (NO) Try covering up the water with a terrain, a plane, or other game objects around the border of the arena.
