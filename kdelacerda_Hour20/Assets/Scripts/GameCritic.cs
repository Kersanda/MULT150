/*  Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.
       The game concept is very simple, and I'd say the game itself is very easy. The objective is very simple - see how long you can survive. 
       The only obstacle - or enemy - is the cube blocks detracting time. The players actions are also very simple - left or right. 
  What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?
       Could add the ability to jump, with incoming obstacles that require the player to jump in order to avoid contact.
       Could also change either the shape or color of some of the objects - maybe only a yellow sphere gives time, but a red sphere detracts.
       To make it easier, could adjust the time each sphere adds, making the game last longer (not necessarily making it easier, but makes 
       the playable time longer, or easier to get a higher game time score.)
  List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.
       Adding a score board that keeps track of the last x amount of runs. 
       Add the ability for two players to compete against each other, and add different powerups or power downs - think mario kart. For example - 
       One player could activate a power up that send a massive rolling rock down the other players screen, which takes up half the game area
       and destroys a few seconds of objects in its path. 
  What 2 parts of the game are fun? 
       The game itself is fun in a simple concept way - something you can just semi mindlessly play. Creating the illusion of forward movement
       was fun, and applying some of the codes we've semi learned into a new way - time adjustment - was fun.  
  What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
       The game isn't tedious - if I had taken the time to type out the code instead of copy/paste - that would have been tedious. I do understand
       that typing it out could/would give me a better idea of what that script is doing, but since I don't have any coding experience, and
       something simple like absently typing Destroy(other.GameObject); breaks the code, because I decided to capitalize the g in game leaving me 
       stumped for a few minutes wondering why it isn't working when I ~thought~ I typed it out verbatum. 
       Perhaps the simple design of the game could be considered tedious, as it doesn't really have an indepth challenge, such as a variety of 
       interactable objects with different effects.  

Changes
       Changed the powerup item (PowerUpTime) to a potion bottle, added a light to the potion, modified the particle effects.
       Added a rotation to the potion bottle. Could not get it to rotate correctly on the Y axis - it seemed to impact its spawn rate and it had a 
       wide spin radius. it worked fine on the Z axis. 
       Changed the obstacle (ObstacleBarrier), added a light and particle effect. Added an animation to change the colors. 
       Changed the color of the walls, so they didn't detract from the obstacles.
